# Project Overview

This project utilizes historical stock data to forecast future stock prices. By using a machine learning approach, it explores various methods for time series forecasting, with a focus on deep learning techniques such as LSTM, known for its effectiveness in sequential data processing. The project aims to assist investors in making data-driven decisions.





## Dataset

The dataset used includes historical stock data, with columns representing features like Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume. It’s sourced from a reliable provider (e.g., Yahoo Finance or Alpha Vantage).

## Project Structure

The notebook consists of the following main sections:

    1. Data Loading and Exploration: Loads historical stock data, visualizes trends, and explores key statistics.
    2. Data Preprocessing: Processes data by normalizing values, handling missing data, and preparing inputs suitable for LSTM.
    3. Model Building: Constructs and compiles an LSTM neural network model to handle sequential dependencies in time series data.
    4. Model Training: Trains the LSTM model on the dataset and optimizes it for prediction accuracy.
    5. Evaluation and Prediction: Tests the model on unseen data, evaluates performance using metrics like MAE or RMSE, and visualizes prediction results.

## Installation and Dependencies
